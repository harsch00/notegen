# Chrome Extension Icons

The extension requires icon files for the Chrome extension to work properly. Currently, placeholder files are in place.

To create proper icons:

1. Create three PNG images:
   - `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
   - `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
   - `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

2. You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons. A simple note icon or microphone icon would be appropriate for this extension.

3. Replace the placeholder files with your actual PNG images.

The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome may show warnings. The functionality will not be affected.
